1. This chapter uses the class rectangleType to illustate how to overload the
operators +, *, ==, !=, >>, and <<. In this exercise, first redefine the class
rectangleType by declaring the instance variables as protected and then
overload additional operators as defined in parts a to c.


c. The operators == and != are overloaded by considering the lengths and
widths of rectangles. Redefine the functions to overload the relational
operator by considering the areas of rectangles as follows: Two rectan-
gles are the same, if they have the same area; otherwise, the rectangles
are not the same. Similary, rectangle yard1 is greater than rectangle
yard2 if the area of yard1 is greater than the area of yard2 . Overload
the remaining relational operators using similar definitions.
d. Write the definitions of the functions to overload the operators defined
in parts a to c.
e. Write a test program that tests various operations on the
class rectangleType.

Redo Programming Exercise 1 by overloading the operators as
nonmembers of the class rectangleType.
b. Write a test program that tests various operations on the
class rectangleType.*/
