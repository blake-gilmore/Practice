1. This chapter uses the class rectangleType to illustate how to overload the
operators +, *, ==, !=, >>, and <<. In this exercise, first redefine the class
rectangleType by declaring the instance variables as protected and then
overload additional operators as defined in parts a to c.
a. Overload the pre- and post-increment and decrement operators to
increment and decrement, respectively, the length and width of a
rectangle by one unit. (Note that after decrementing the length and
width, they must be postive.)
b. Overload the binary operator - to subtract the dimensions of one
rectangle from the corresponding dimensions of another rectangle. If
the resulting dimensions are not positive, output an appropriate message
and do not perform the operation.
c. The operators == and != are overloaded by considering the lengths and
widths of rectangles. Redefine the functions to overload the relational
operator by considering the areas of rectangles as follows: Two rectan-
gles are the same, if they have the same area; otherwise, the rectangles
are not the same. Similary, rectangle yard1 is greater than rectangle
yard2 if the area of yard1 is greater than the area of yard2 . Overload
the remaining relational operators using similar definitions.
d. Write the definitions of the functions to overload the operators defined
in parts a to c.
e. Write a test program that tests various operations on the
class rectangleType.

Redo Programming Exercise 1 by overloading the operators as
nonmembers of the class rectangleType.
b. Write a test program that tests various operations on the
class rectangleType.*/
